#maths basic with python3

Math is a pretty popular topic, so we should probably learn how to do it in Python 3. 
Luckily for us, math is so very popular that it works extremely simply.

1+3		

Here, we have some simple addition, the returned number is 4.

4*4		

Next up, multiplication, fancy stuff! The return is 16.

5-2		

Subtraction, even fancier. Return will be 3

5/2

Division, now this is actually fancy, based on Python's history.

In Python 2, the division does not necessarily work in the way expected. 
If you divide two whole numbers, you will be returned a whole number. 
You must divide one of the numbers as a float in order to get a proper return.
This was changed in Python 3+, and now you always get expected division, yay!

#exponents
		4**4
		

There is another way to do exponents, but this works just fine, and is a familiar syntax for it.

That's it for basic math. 
It really is quite simple. Math is quite integral to a lot of programs,
so it is very nice that it is kept simple enough.

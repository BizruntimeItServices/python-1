#if statement:


The if statement is one of the most basic forms of logic that can be introduced into your program.
The idea of the if statement is to assess whether something is the case
and, if it is, then to perform the following block of code within the statement.

Here is an example of an if statement:

x = 5
y = 10

if x > y:
    print('x is greater than y')

Here, 
we define the variables x and y.
Then, we ask if x is greater than y. 
If it is, then we will print 'x is greater than y.'
If it is not, then nothing will happen.

In this case,
5 is not greater than 10,
so nothing will happen.

x = 5
y = 10

if x < y:
    print('x is less than y')

Now,
we've flipped the comparison operator,
to say if x is less than y. 
Basically, if 5 is less than 10.
In this case, the statement is true, and the output will be 'x is less than y.'

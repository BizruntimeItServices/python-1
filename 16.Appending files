#appending files

Now we get to appending a file in python. I will just state again that writing will clear the file and write to it just the data you specify in the write operation. Appending will simply take what was already there, and add the new data to it.

That said, when you actually go to add to the file, you will still use ".write." You only specify that you will be appending instead of writing when you open the file and specify your intentions.

Let's look at an example:

# so here, generally it can be a good idea to start with a newline, since
# otherwise it will append data on the same line as the file left off.
# you might want that, but I'll use a new line.
# another option used is to first append just a simple newline
# then append what you want. 
appendMe = '\nNew bit of information'

appendFile = open('exampleFile.txt','a')
appendFile.write(appendMe)
appendFile.close()

What will happen here is, if exampleFile.txt already exists, the appendMe line will be added to it. If that file does not already exist, then it will be created.

Why Python?

Python is very beginner-friendly.
The syntax (words and structure) is extremely simple to read and follow,
most of which can be understood even if you do not know any programming.
      
     #code
     Garage = "Ferrari", "Honda", "Porsche", "Toyota"
          for each_car in Garage:
	        print(each_car)

"print()" is a built-in Python function that will output some text to the console.

When someone says to "print to the console," they are referring to where information from your program is ouput. This might be a command prompt (CMD.exe), the terminal for Mac/Linux users, or the interactive prompt in IDLE. You will see an example of "output to console" below.

Looking at the code about cars in the garage, can you guess what will happen? You probably have a general idea. For each_car in the garage, we're going to do something. What are we doing? We are printing each car.

Since "printing" outputs some text to the "console," you can probably figure out that the console will say something like "Ferrari, Honda, Porsche, Toyota."

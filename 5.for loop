#for loop:


for eachThing in thisThing:
    do this stuff
    in this block

The next loop is the For loop.
The idea of the for loop is to "iterate" through something. 
For each thing in that something, it will do a block of code. 
Most often, you will see a for loop's structure very much like this.

So, again, why would someone use each type of loop?

Typically, you will see the while loop being used for finite tasks that have predetermined length, 
and the for loop being used for tasks that have uncertain and variable time-frames.

That said, the for loop can be used for the exact same tasks as the while loop.

For this reason,
I prefer the for loop myself, 
but again, it comes down to personal preference.

Here's an example of a for loop:

exampleList = [1,5,6,6,2,1,5,2,1,4]

for x in exampleList:
    print(x)

This code will print out each item in that list.
Usually, people will choose to actually do something with the item in the list, more than just printing it out, but this is just a basic example.

Another example of a for loop is in the case of something like:

for x in range(1,11):
    print(x)

This code is actually what is known as a generator function, and is highly efficient. The above works very much like the "counter" function we made with a while loop. The only difference is this one is much faster and more efficient in many cases.
